A cloud hosting website using HTML and CSS, just for practice styling.
This website is fully responsive and suitable for small and large screens.

## BEM
I used BEM which is a naming convention to separate logic from skins and have a better stylesheet.
We use three kinds of naming to specify a block, elements within that block, and its modifiers which change the skin on that block.
You can read more about it [here](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/).

## Object-oriented CSS
I also tried to use object-oriented CSS principles to write a more maintainable style.
Check this awesome technique [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/).
